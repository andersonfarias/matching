# matching
Coding challenge proposed by the company called Sortable. The problem is know as Object Matching (also referred to as duplicate identification, record linkage, entity resolution or reference reconciliation) and is a crucial task for data integration and data cleaning. The task is to detect multiple representations of the same real-world object. This is a challenging task particularly for objects that are highly heterogeneous and of limited data quality, e.g., regarding completeness and consistency of their descriptions. The goal is to match product listings from a 3rd party retailer, e.g. “Nikon D90 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)” against a set of known products, e.g. “Nikon D90”.
