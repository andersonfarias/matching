/**
 * Represents one strategy to blocking.
 * 
 * The standard (naive) approach to find matches in n input objects is to
 * compare each object with every other object. This requires lots of
 * comparisons, basically a complete Cartesian product (OA Ã— OB ) is examined.
 * The resulting quadratic complexity of O(n2) results in infeasible execution
 * times in particular for large input sets. Therefore, an initial step in the
 * matching process called blocking is commonly applied to reduce the search
 * space to a small subset of the most likely matching object pairs.
 * 
 * Blocking approaches semantically partition the input data into blocks of
 * similar objects and restrict object matching to objects of the same block.
